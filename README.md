# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Scam and Legitimate Cases.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyse transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies related to fraudulent activities. 
It includes:
 - Data extraction and transformation using **SQL** 
 - Conducted detailed data exploration and preprocessing using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
 - Creation of insightful interactive dashboard to present key findings and support decision-making

## Dataset

 * Source: The dataset is a subset (`creditcard_subset.csv`) derived from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset due to its large size, containing 50,000 transactions. 

 * Key Columns:
    - `Time`: Transaction timestamp (in seconds).
    - `V1`â€“`V28`: Principal components from PCA transformation (anonymised features).
    - `Amount`: Transaction amount in EUR.
    - `Class`: Binary label (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud, ~0.17% fraud rate).

 * Additional Tables:   
    - `fraud_by_hour.csv`: Hourly fraud counts.
    - `amount_by_fraud.csv`: Average amounts by class.
    - `top_fraud_days.csv`: High-fraud days with amounts.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing values in `creditcard_subset.csv`
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Calculated fraud percentage (~0.17%) and aggregated data by hour and amount
- **Segmentation**: Categorised transactions into fraud and legitimate classes using Class.

Visualisation Created:
- "Histogram of transaction amounts", 
- "Line charts for hourly fraud frequency",
- "Interactive Tableau dashboard with filters (Hour, Amount) and KPIs (Fraud Percentage, Total Fraud Cases)"

## Findings
- **Fraud Prevalence**: Approximately 0.17% of transactions are fraudulent (~85 out of 50,000), consistent with the Kaggle dataset.
- **Amount Distribution**: Fraud transactions average â‚¬164.23, while legitimate ones average â‚¬87.25, indicating higher-value frauds.
- **Time Patterns**: Fraud peaks vary by hour, with potential clustering (visualised in the dashboard).
- **Insight**: High-spending users (e.g., >â‚¬500) contribute to a disproportionate share of fraud cases, suggesting that high-value transactions may require targeted monitoring.
